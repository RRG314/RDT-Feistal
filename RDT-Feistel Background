# RDT-Feistel Background

## Concept Overview
RDT-Feistel is a deterministic and reversible permutation system derived from
Recursive Division Theory (RDT) — a mathematical framework that describes
integer magnitude through recursive logarithmic division rather than
factorization.

In RDT, each integer *n* is assigned a recursive depth, defined as the number
of iterations required to reduce *n* to 1 under a logarithmic division rule:

    RDT(n) = number of iterations such that  
    x_{i+1} = floor( x_i / max(2, floor((log x_i)^α)) )

For large *n*, this depth grows proportionally to log(log n), forming a
multi-scale hierarchy of recursive "shells."  
This scaling law defines a bounded recursive geometry — slow-growing,
self-similar, and structurally stable.

## Integration with a Feistel System
A Feistel network provides a symmetric structure for reversible transformations.
RDT-Feistel incorporates the recursive-depth law into its indexing and diffusion
process as follows:

1. **Index geometry:** each byte position is ranked by its recursive depth
   RDT(i + 2, α). Positions sharing the same depth form shells that represent
   similar logarithmic magnitude.

2. **Permutation:** the right half of the data is reordered according to this
   RDT-based geometry before each round.

3. **Nonlinear mixing:** the left half is updated using a reversible
   transformation F(L, R) that includes:
   - Golden-ratio rotations (φ = 1.618...) for irrational offset,
   - Modular arithmetic and position-dependent XOR operations,
   - Optional global bit rotation and MDS (MixColumns-style) diffusion in the
     enhanced **v3f** variant.

These steps yield a deterministic permutation with near-uniform output
statistics while remaining mathematically invertible.

## Mathematical Structure

### Recursive Division Law
For the standard parameter α ≈ 1.5, the expected recursive depth follows:

    RDT(n) ≈ c * log(log n),  where  c ≈ 2.2

This relationship defines the intrinsic rate of decay in the recursive process.
When mapped to data indices, the Feistel network inherits this bounded,
hierarchical scaling behavior.

### Feistel Reversibility
Each iteration satisfies:

    L_{t+1} = R_t
    R_{t+1} = L_t XOR F(R_t)

where F is a bijective byte-wise transformation based on rotations and modular
arithmetic. Because both halves are of equal length and every operation is
reversible, the entire mapping remains a bijection over the input space.

### Entropy Behavior
The system converges toward a Shannon entropy of 8 bits per byte for structured
input data. RDT-based index ordering induces multi-scale diffusion, while
golden-ratio rotation prevents harmonic locking, producing a strong avalanche
effect without relying on stochastic randomness.

## Physical Interpretation
The recursive division law parallels the diffusive damping behavior observed in
resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). As MHD closure equations regulate magnetic
energy through continuous diffusion, RDT-Feistel applies a discrete analog of
recursive damping across data indices. This correspondence forms the conceptual
basis for later integrations with energy-stabilized optimizers such as
Topological Adam.

## Purpose
RDT-Feistel serves as a mathematical prototype for exploring deterministic
entropy growth, reversible diffusion, and recursive geometric structures in
digital systems. It is not intended as an encryption mechanism but as a
reproducible framework for studying structured entropy transformations and
multi-scale diffusion dynamics.
